## Hi there 👋 I'm Mahidhar Reddy Karakala

🚀 **Upcoming Associate Application Developer @ Thoughtworks**  
🎓 Final-year B.Tech IT student at VIT (CGPA: 9.04)  
💻 Backend-focused engineer passionate about **System Design, Distributed Systems & Secure APIs**

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend-focused developer who enjoys designing **scalable, reliable, and secure systems**.  
I work primarily with **Node.js and Go**, building RESTful APIs, microservices, and cloud-native applications.

I strongly believe that **good system design is about trade-offs** — scalability vs consistency, latency vs cost — and I enjoy reasoning about these decisions while building production-ready software.

## 🧠 System Design Interests

I actively focus on:

- Designing **scalable backend architectures**
- Breaking monoliths into **microservices**
- API gateway & authentication flows
- Caching strategies using Redis
- Database schema design & indexing
- Fault tolerance & reliability
- Rate limiting, retries, and idempotency
- Observability (logs, metrics, error handling)

I enjoy drawing system design diagrams and thinking through **real-world constraints** like traffic spikes, failures, and security threats.
